Below are the test cases we were able to come up with as a group, making sure that we all participate and contribute into making the system as air-tight as possible.

The test cases were put in chronological order of operation for everyone to have a clear understanding on how to attack and collaborate more efficiantly.

##  Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned

### 1.  Lack of Early Direction
Our team often found ourselves unsure of the exact deliverables or expectations at the start of each phase. It took additional time to understand the task requirements clearly, which delayed progress and test preparation.

### 2.  Last-Minute Collaborations
We tended to start collaborating only close to deadlines. While we managed to pull things together, the lack of early coordination affected the quality and efficiency of our contributions. Testing responsibilities sometimes overlapped or were missed.

### 3.  Communication Gaps
There was minimal communication during the week regarding task status, updates, or planning for the next steps. This led to confusion about who was working on what, and whether the current phase had started or not.

### 4.  Technical Issues Encountered
- **Missing form validation**: We had to manually identify and implement missing validation logic in the Pickup and Feedback forms (e.g., name length, preferred date, empty feedback comments).
- **LocalStorage resets**: During testing, localStorage would reset on page refresh, leading to data loss and forced re-entry of test data.
- **Hardcoded filter bug**: A filter function intended for “Eldoret” requests was returning “Nairobi” data due to a copy-paste logic flaw we had to trace and document.
- **Session persistence inconsistencies**: Authentication state wasn't retained properly on refresh until we debugged the `getCurrentUser()` logic and browser behavior.

### 5.  Security Oversights
We discovered during review that passwords were stored in plain text and that there was no authorization check on sensitive admin functions. These issues were noted and are planned for future hardening.

---

###  What We Learned
- Starting earlier and discussing weekly milestones improves collaboration.
- Regular check-ins (even async messages) could prevent overlaps or confusion.
- Early manual testing helped catch issues that could be missed by code reviews alone.
- Building test cases *while coding* makes the process more efficient and accurate.
